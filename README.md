#### Instructions for Haiku Merch Site

Build a website for selling merchandise for a band, author, sports team, or any other purveyor that interests you.

A user should be able to do the following:

- Create, Read, Update and Delete items in the store. Items should have fields for name, description, and quantity (along with any other fields you wish to add).
- Increase or decrease the quantity of an item in the store. For instance, if a user clicks "Buy", the quantity will decrease by one. If a user clicks "Restock", it will increment by a specified number.
- When the quantity of an item is reduced to 0, the item should say "Out of Stock". A user should not be able to reduce the quantity of an item below 0.
